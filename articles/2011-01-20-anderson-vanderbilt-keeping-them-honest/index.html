<p>I normally think Anderson Vandbilt’s mantra of “Keeping Them Honest” is silly, but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4IHQV4_xA0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this interview</a> with Rep. Steve Cohen is a slam dunk. </p>

<p>Anderson Vanderbilt is slamming him for using Nazi comparisons to describe the Republicans in Congress.</p>

<p>Note also that Cohen just <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/issues/56_65/-202334-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">penned an article</a> called “Reckless Speech Has Terrible Human Cost”.</p>

<p><strong><em>lulz</em></strong></p>

<p>In researching this story, I also found out that Anderson Vanderbilt <a href="http://www.nnp.org/nni/Publications/Dutch-American/cooper.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interned for the C.I.A.</a> after he went to Yale.</p>

<p>You’re telling me there’s another spook on television?</p>

<p><em>WAT?! </em></p>
